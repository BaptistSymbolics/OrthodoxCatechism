The Preface: 
Nehemiah ſearched into the particulat 
parts of Gods Worſhip, by which means they 
came to the pradtice of that almoſt loſt Ordi- 
nance of God, the Feaft of Tabernacles, 
which for many years was not pratiſed after 
the due order, though a generaF notion was re- 
tained about it, I ſay,under theſe Confiderati= . 
ons,T have in charitable regard to your Souls, 
preſented you with this ſmall ( but Tam bold 
to ſay) ſound piece of Divinity, which may

Babes, and Meat for ſtrong Men, It may not 
znfitly be compared to the Waters of the San- 
auary, where ſome may go up tothe Ancles, 
others to the Knees, others to the Loint, and 
they are deep enough for others to ſwim ins 
Here you are not only taught to be good 


 Chriltians, but good Moraliſts 3 the wart 


of which among them that have the Leaves 
and Lamps of Profeſſion- ( as *tis to be feared 


| ſuch-have little more) is of a heart-breaking. 


"> qpdmns to many that deſire to walk wit- 
God. 
Now albeit here' may be many things 
which ſome of you may know already, yet unto 
ſuch thoſe things T hope will be as acceptable 
as St. Peter's Epiſtles were ta the ſcattered-

Saints, though they knew much of the matter 


befare; yet I dare ſay here is ſomethings which | 


may be for information as well as eſftabliſh- 
ment to the moſt knowing among you, 

1 have not undertaken to preſent you with 
new Notions or Principles, boping an Athe- 
nian Spirit js in none of you, but do believe 


that an old Goſpel (to you that have tafted 
the ſweetneſs of it_) will be more acceptable 


than a new, though publiſhed by an Angel 


from Heaven.

wherein T bave taken a little pains- to ſhew 
. youthe true form of God's Houſe, with the 
coming in thereof, and the going ont thereof : 
but I hope my Zeal in this will not be mifin- 
zerpreted by any that truly fear God. That 
God whom we ſerve is very jealous of bis Wor

Law of his Houſe bath bin preſerved and con- 


tinued to us, we look, upon it as our Dutyin

a great dea[of pains to cleanſe th: Houſe of 
God, and ſet all things in order, that were out 
of order, particularly cauſed the Peqple to keep 
the Paſſover according to the Inſtitution: for it 
had not, ſaith the Text, bin of a long timekept

pure Inſtitutions of Chriſt were not for ſome 
' bundred of years praftiſed according to the du? 
 order,orvery little, through the Innovaſions of 
Antichriſt 3 And as Circumciſion * for about 
forty years was unprattiſed inthe Wildedeſ7, 
- yet 45 Joſuah puts this duty inprattice as ſoon 
as God ſignified his mind in that particulars

Now albeit there are ſome differences be- 
tween many Godly Divines and us in Church- 
Conſtitution, yet inaſmuch as thoſe- things 
are not the Eſſence of Chriſtianity, but that 
we do agree in the fundamental Dofrine 
thereof, there is ſufficient ground to lay aſit'e 
all bitterngſs and prejudice, and labour to 
maintain a ſpirit of Love each to other, know - 
ing we ſhall never ſee all alike here. We 
find in the primitive times that the Baptiſm of

Chriſt Teſus, as they did heir difficult caſes

others of his Appointment: as for inſtance, 
Afts 4-the Place was ſhaken, as the effe&t

the holy Ordinance of Baptiſm extraordi- 
narily, when the Spirit came in the like- 
neſs of a Dove, and fate upon our Saviour 
Chriſt as he came out of the Water, Mat.3, 
and a Voice heard from Heaven, ſaying, 
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well 
pleaſed. Alſo the Eunuch's Baptiſm was 
wonderfully confirmed to him in God's 
taking away Philip as ſoon as he came 
up out of the Water, inſomuch that he 
went away rejoycing. Now, Beloved, as 
Prayer, Baptiſme, Preaching, doth not 
ceaſe, though it be not ſo miraculouſly 
owned as in the Primitive times 3 nei- 
ther doth laying on of Hands ceaſe, from 
the ſame Parity of Reaſon, though it be

to repent, believe, be baptized, believe 
the Reſurrection of the dead, and eternal 


Judgments and why this of laying on of 


Hands ſhould be excluded from being 
the Practice of every Chriſtian, being a

Ar Appendix concerning the Qr- 
 dinance of Oinging. 


KY dearly Beloved, whether Churches in 

KF general, or Chriſtians in particular, 

» wherever this Appexzdix may come : 
Foraſmuch as Singing is generally owned to be a 
Goſpel-Ordinance ;-but the great doubt is with 
manys- whar oughr to be the matter of* che Song;: 
and what manner and mode-we ought to. ſing in >: 
alſo knowingy that it is hearrily defired by many: 
Officers, and other particular Members;of fone. 
Churches of Chriſt, that they could agree 
| together to perform this Ordinance of God, eſpeci- 
ally art. the Lord's Table, & Supper ofithe Lord, as 
Chrift himſelf, and his Apoſtles, did; and thar 


the Churches may come to the pradtice of this Or-. 


dinance, which tor many years hath-been loſt in. 
many Churches, (as the Feaſt of!Tabernacles was. 


for a long time) I mean, Singing after the Lord's: 
Supper : This is my great deſign to-them- that do: 


not practiſe ir, altho it is very clear-tliat:this:Or- 
dinance-was praQifed at other times.by theChurch 


in general,- and Saints in particular, which hope. 


all Churches will tucther praCtiſe; as God ſhall en= 
lighten them into it upon their diligent ſearch. 


| 'That Singing. vocally and: audibly, harh beed-

is clear : 

I. won 1 —= to. the tv ns

Office, but as a Cammand antncktls on al; 

2, The Apolile diſtinguiſherh this Ordinance 
from that of preaching, or teaching docrinallys 
which belongeth to the Officers, or occaſionally , 
to a gifted Brother : For he doth not ſay, as in 
other places, Teach and admoniſh ; but gives us 


the modification of this Admonition; in Pſalms, - 


and Hymns, andſpiritual Songs, 
. - wirg. It Asprailing God is a Moral Duty, fo 
Singing is often Link's with thatMoral Duty,which 
is univerſally obliging and perpetually binding, 
namely, Prayer : Fam. 5. 13+ is any among you 
affiited 2 cIet him pray ; Is any merry 2-let bim

Prayer, we all grant, is a Moral Duty, and. is 


always obliging.. We ought to ackhowkdg God 
the Giver of: all goad things, in praying vato. him.

But yet alſo 1 do think, that we are at our li- 
berty to compoſe other parts or portions of God's 
Word to that end ; providedour Hymns areto und-

be called the Word of God;  or-fpiritual Hymns. 
For, as--2 learned Man ſaith; *cis the-ſence and 
meaning is the Word of God, whether in Proſe, 
or in Meeter ; and: further faith, 'We may as 
well be ſaid to fing God's Word, as to read it ; 
it is only orderly compoſed and diſpoſed for that

to the Analogy of Faith, and founded: on: God's

correſpond* with facred VVrir, notwithſtanding 
any pretence of an extraordinary Inſpiration, I am
