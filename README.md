[Versioned releases can be found here.](https://github.com/BaptistSymbolics/OrthodoxCatechism/releases)

## Project Overview

This project serves as a collaborative, open-source hub for maintaining and preserving the Orthodox Catechism. Our goal is to provide a publicly accessible, freely distributable version of this important theological document that can be improved and shared by the community.

## Background

This project aims to preserve and refine this theological resource, building upon the infrastructure and methodology developed for the Baptist Larger Catechism project.

### Project Motivation

This project was initiated to:
- Preserve the existing work
- Provide a transparent, version-controlled document
- Enable community contributions and discussions
- Make the catechism freely available in multiple formats

## Features

- Structured data maintained in TOML format
- Version-controlled document history
- Publicly accessible PDF generation
- Open collaboration model
- Creative Commons licensed
- Modernized language (thy→your, thee→you, etc.)
- Proper footnote structure with biblical references

## TOML Structure and Footnote System

### How TOML Corresponds to Footnotes

The TOML format uses multiple `[[sections]]` blocks to create numbered footnotes in the final PDF output. Each section corresponds to a superscript number in the text:

**TOML Structure:**
```toml
[[sections]]
text = "That both in Soul and"
verses = "1 Corinthians 6:19; 1 Thessalonians 5:10"

[[sections]]
text = "Body, whether I live or die"
verses = "Romans 14:8"
```

**PDF Output:**
- Text appears with superscript numbers (¹, ², ³, etc.)
- Footnotes appear at bottom with corresponding biblical references
- Each section's `verses` field becomes the footnote content

### Language Modernization

This project modernizes archaic language while preserving theological accuracy:

- **thy** → **your**
- **thee** → **you** 
- **thou** → **you**
- **hath** → **has**
- **doth** → **does**
- **maketh** → **makes**
- **preserveth** → **preserves**
- **assureth** → **assures**

### Original vs. Modernized Example

**Original (1650s):**
> "What is thy only comfort in Life and Death? That both in Soul and Body, whether I live or dye, I am not mine own, but belong wholly unto my most faithful Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: who by his most precious Blood fully satisfying for all my Sins, hath delivered me from all the power of the Devil, and so preserveth me..."

**Modernized:**
> "What is your only comfort in Life and Death? That both in Soul and Body, whether I live or die, I am not mine own, but belong wholly unto my most faithful Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: who by his most precious Blood fully satisfying for all my Sins, has delivered me from all the power of the Devil, and so preserves me..."

## Releases

Current releases include downloadable PDF versions of the Orthodox Catechism. Future plans include:
- Multiple print-ready formats
- Versioned releases
- Potential additional Orthodox theological documents

## TOML Conversion Standards

### Reference Standard: 001.toml

The file `src/001.toml` serves as the **reference standard** for all other questions. All TOML files should follow this exact format:

```toml
id = "1"
question = "What is your only comfort in Life and Death?"

[[sections]]
text = "That both in Soul and"
verses = "1 Corinthians 6:19; 1 Thessalonians 5:10"

[[sections]]
text = "Body, whether I live or die"
verses = "Romans 14:8"

[[sections]]
text = ", I am not mine own, but"
verses = "1 Corinthians 3:23"
```

### Conversion Guidelines for All Questions

When converting questions to match the 001.toml standard:

#### 1. **Language Modernization**
- thy → your
- thee → you
- thou → you
- hath → has
- doth → does
- maketh → makes
- preserveth → preserves
- assureth → assures
- dye → die

#### 2. **Scripture Reference Format**
- Use full book names: "1 Corinthians" not "1 Cor."
- Separate multiple references with "; "
- Use hyphens for verse ranges: "1:18-19" not "1. 18, 19"
- Remove OCR artifacts like "(a)", "(b)", "(c)" markers

#### 3. **Section Structure**
- Break answers into logical `[[sections]]` blocks
- Each section should end at a natural pause or biblical reference point
- Each section gets its own `verses` field with relevant Scripture references
- Remove OCR artifacts and formatting errors

#### 4. **Clean Text Requirements**
- Remove OCR artifacts like "þ", "3", "T-", "nd -", etc.
- Fix spacing and punctuation
- Ensure proper capitalization
- Remove page break artifacts and formatting remnants

### Current Status (149 questions total)

#### Existing Files (10 files) - ALL COMPLETED! ✅
- ✅ **001.toml** - Fully converted and standardized (REFERENCE STANDARD)
- ✅ **002.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **003.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **004.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **005.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **006.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **007.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **008.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **009.toml** - Fully converted and standardized
- ✅ **010.toml** - Fully converted and standardized

#### Missing Files (139 files)
- ❌ **011.toml through 149.toml** - Need to be created from OCR text

**Progress: 10/149 files completed (6.7%)**

### Project Scope
This is a substantial conversion project requiring:
1. **Conversion of existing files** (002-010.toml): 9 files need OCR cleanup and modernization
2. **Creation of new files** (011-149.toml): 139 files need to be extracted from the OCR text and formatted
3. **Quality assurance**: All files must match the 001.toml reference standard

### Conversion Workflow
For this large-scale project, contributors should:

1. **Start with existing files** (002-010.toml) to practice the conversion process
2. **Use the OCR text** (`original/orthodox-catechism-ocr.txt`) as source material for missing questions
3. **Follow the 001.toml template** exactly for structure and formatting
4. **Extract questions systematically** from the OCR text, looking for "Q." or "Quest." patterns
5. **Apply language modernization** consistently across all files
6. **Verify biblical references** and format them according to the standard

### Automation Opportunities
Given the scale (149 files), consider developing:
- Scripts to extract Q&A pairs from the OCR text
- Automated language modernization tools
- Batch processing for biblical reference formatting
- Quality assurance checks against the 001.toml standard

### Conversion Priority
All remaining TOML files should be converted to match the 001.toml standard to ensure:
- Consistent formatting across all questions
- Proper footnote generation in PDF output
- Modern, readable language
- Clean biblical references

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:
- **Convert TOML files** to match the 001.toml standard
- Review existing questions and answers
- Propose improvements
- Discuss theological interpretations
- Help with formatting and documentation

**Priority Contribution**: Help convert the remaining TOML files (002.toml onwards) to match the 001.toml reference standard.
