[[sections]]
text = "All things which are promised us in the Gospel: the sum whereof is briefly comprised in the Articles of the Catholic and undoubted Faith of all true Christians, commonly called the Creed. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord; which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead & buried, he descended into Hell; the third day he arose again from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from whence he shall come to judge both the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the Resurrection of the Body, and the life everlasting. Amen."
