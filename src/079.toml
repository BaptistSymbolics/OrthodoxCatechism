text = "Whatever pretence there may be for the Infants of Believers to be Baptized first, as their being the Seed of Believers; or secondly, their being in the Covenant; or thirdly, that the Infant-Seed of Abraham a Believer, was circumcised; all this avails nothing: for Circumcision was limited to such a Family, the Family of Abraham, all others, though Believers, were excluded; also limited to such a day, the eighth day, and whatever pretence might be made, it was not to be done before nor after; limited also to such a Sex, the Male, not the Female; which if Baptism came in the room of Circumcision, and is the Seal of the Covenant under the Gospel, as Circumcision was under the Law, none but the Males must be Baptized, because none but the Males were Circumcised; but as under the Law respecting Circumcision, so now under the Gospel respecting Baptism, it depends purely upon the will of the Law-giver, at what season, upon what Persons and terms Baptism is to be administered; unto which Prophet we shall all do well to hearken, Acts 3:22."
