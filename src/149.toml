text = "We are not; our Lord here delivers to his Church a brief Sum of those things which we are to ask of God, but yet Christ will have us also to descend unto specials, and to ask particular Benefits: for this Form prescribed is nothing else but a Set or Course of certain Headings or Categories, to which all Benefits both corporal and spiritual may be referred; but yet all particulars of Prayer must agree & correspond with this general Form, although we are not tied to this Form, as appears from James 1:5, where the Apostle exhorts the Saints, if any did lack Wisdom, they should ask of God, which gives to all liberally, but these as touching the Words, are not in the Form of Prayer particularly expressed, though they are included. Besides, we have Examples of Prayer both in the old and new Testament, which are not the very Form here expressed, even though all they asked was comprehended in this Prayer; therefore the Form of Prayer delivered unto us by Christ, is wholly a thing indifferent."
